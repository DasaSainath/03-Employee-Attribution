# 🏢 Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict **employee attrition** in an organization using **Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science techniques**. By identifying factors that influence attrition, companies can take proactive measures to improve retention and workforce stability.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess employee data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify key trends and factors affecting attrition.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform categorical and numerical data for better predictions.
- **Model Development**: Train various ML models to classify employees as **retained or likely to leave**.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Develop a web-based tool for real-time attrition prediction (future scope).

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains employee-related information, including:
  - **Age, Job Role, Salary, Experience, Department, and Work-Life Balance**.
  - **Attrition Status**: The target variable (Yes/No).
- Data is stored in `employee_attrition.csv`.

## 🔍 Data Processing & Analysis
1. **Handling Missing Values & Outliers**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing attrition trends across different departments and job roles.
   - Identifying correlations between salary, work-life balance, and attrition.
3. **Feature Encoding**
   - Converting categorical variables into numerical form using One-Hot Encoding.

## 🏗️ Model Development
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- **Advanced Models**: Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models for improved accuracy.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model using **Flask/Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
- Integrate deep learning models for better classification.
- Implement explainable AI techniques for insights into predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn & XGBoost** (Machine Learning)
